    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

    <p>
      In CSS we are given many tools, commands, and properties to work with.
      They enable coders and web designers to beautify their work, making their
      sites coherent, easy on the eyes, and all-together more fun to look at and
      explore. This includes creating margins, borders, and paddings that
      surrounds/outlines text and/or images. Understanding the differences
      between the three are crucial to using each correctly and to their full
      potential.

      Creating a border is akin to drawing a bow around a chunk of text. You can
      draw this box in your code editor by inserting your border class within
      the style block where you can give it specific properties, customizing the
      border colour, style and width. A border is great for isolating a specific
      section of your website or highlighting its contents to illustrate its
      importance.

    <p>
      Margins and paddings are like two sides of the same coin; they determine
      how much space is given outside and inside a border relevant to its
      contents. Now, you don’t have to have a border in order to add margins or
      paddings to your website; The way that they’re written are also very
      similar to how you would insert a border into your code. You can customise
      your margins by specifying how many pixels of space you’d like to stand
      between your border and the frame of the device that is viewing the
      website. Padding is almost exactly as your choose how many pixels of space
      you’d like to separate the text withing the border and the border’s
      outline.

    <p>
      When wanting to insert borders, margins, or paddings to your website, it
      is recommended to start with your style block where you can create a CSS
      selector for any paragraph you wish to give a border, padding or margin.

    <pre class="my-border">
    
       &lt;style&gt;
        .thin-red-border {
          border-color: red;
          border-width: 5px;
          border-style: solid;
        }
      
      &lt;/style&gt;
    </pre>
