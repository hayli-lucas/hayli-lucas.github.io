      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
      In CSS we are given many tools, commands, and properties to work with.
      They enable coders and web designers to beautify their work, making their
      sites coherent, easy on the eyes, and all-together more fun to look at and
      explore. This includes creating margins, borders, and paddings that
      surrounds/outlines text and/or images. Understanding the differences
      between the three are crucial to using each correctly and to their full
      potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a border is akin to drawing a bow around a chunk of text. You can
      draw this box in your code editor by inserting your border class within
      the style block where you can give it specific properties, customizing the
      border colour, style and width. A border is great for isolating a specific
      section of your website or highlighting its contents to illustrate its
      importance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Margins and paddings are like two sides of the same coin; they determine
      how much space is given outside and inside a border relevant to its
      contents. Now, you don’t have to have a border in order to add margins or
      paddings to your website; The way that they’re written are also very
      similar to how you would insert a border into your code. You can customise
      your margins by specifying how many pixels of space you’d like to stand
      between your border and the frame of the device that is viewing the
      website. Padding is almost exactly as you choose how many pixels of space
      you’d like to separate the text withing the border and the border’s
      outline.
    </p>

    <h1 class="image-container">How to add a Border, Margin, and/or Padding</h1>

    <p>
      When wanting to insert borders, margins, or paddings to your website, it
      is recommended to start with your style block where you can create a
      border class element that can be applied to any paragraph you wish to give
      a border, padding or margin.
    </p>

    <pre class="my-border">
    
       &lt;style&gt;
        .thin-red-border {
          border-color: red;
          border-width: 2px;
          border-style: solid;
        }
      &lt;/style&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here we are creating a class element named "thin-red-border" that will
      have red solid line that is two pixels thick. now if we were to give a
      chunk of text this border, we would inset this class element within our
      paragraph (or p) element to give us our border.
    </p>

    <pre class="thin-red-border">
   &lt;p class="thin-red-border"&gt;
   insert some random text here to put the border around so show this imaginary
   audience how it's done...
   but dont forget to put something actually relevant or funny 
   so this actually has a chance of being coherant or simply readable...
   &lt;/p&gt;
   </pre
    >
    <p>
      And there you go. Now, working with margins and paddings are very similar.
      You can simply add their properties to your style border. Remember that
      these properties are not restricted to just working with borders but for
      the sake of this example, that's exactly what we will be doing.
    </p>
    <pre class="my-border">
    
       &lt;style&gt;
        .new-thin-red-border {
          border-color: red;
          border-width: 2px;
          border-style: solid;
          margin: 20px 100px 20px 20px;
          padding: 20px 100px 20px 20px;
        }
      
      &lt;/style&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice that we have added two new properties to our current style class to
      create a new one. The margin and padding works in a clock-wise rotation so
      the top, bottom, and left side of the border lines will have an open space
      of 20 pixels, and the right side has a space of 100 pixels.
    </p>
    <pre class="new-thin-red-border">
   &lt;p class="new-thin-red-border"&gt;
   insert some random text here to put the border around so show this imaginary
   audience how it's done...
   but dont forget to put something actually relevant or funny 
   so this actually has a chance of being coherant or simply readable...
   &lt;/p&gt;
   </pre

      Can you see the difference? Working with borders, margins, and paddings
      can be intimidating at first to most beginner coders (I know it certainly
      was for me) but once you got the basics down (or dare I say, laid down
      your foundation...), you will find that it's all a matter of bossing your
      computer around, telling it what to do. Now I encourage you, dear reader
      to go give it a shot for yourself. Don't confine yourself to a thick
      border with minimal padding and over-exaggerated margins.
