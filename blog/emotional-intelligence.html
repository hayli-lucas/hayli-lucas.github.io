      What is emotional intelligence? Intelligence is a measurement of what you
      know. Emotional intelligence would measure how much you know about your
      own emotions/feelings and the emotions/feelings of others. It’s the
      ability to recognise what actions cause certain emotions in others and
      yourself granting you with the skills to find a path or a solution to a
      problem without causing distress. Possessing emotional intelligence would
      aid you with your own self-regulation, your social skills and empathy, and
      be a great motivation towards a certain solution that would best benefit
      everyone or at least the majority.

      How is EQ different to IQ? EQ is how we understand the emotions of
      ourselves and others, whereas IQ is more based on logic, facts, and
      reasoning. Someone with a strong IQ leads more with their head while
      someone with a strong EQ leads more with their heart. EQ bases its
      decisions on the emotions of themselves and others and would try to find a
      solution that would cause the least amount of distress; IQ would lead on a
      bases of what it believes to be the most logical solution without the
      consideration of what emotions its solution entails.

      Why is EQ important? Having a high EQ but a low IQ is simply not as bad as
      having a high IQ with a low EQ. You can be the smartest person in the room
      but if you don’t have the social skills, empathy, or any proper regulation
      of your own emotions, you can lead yourself down a very dark path. Having
      a certain level of emotional intelligence is crucial for any social
      interaction whether formal or informal. It’s all about balance.
