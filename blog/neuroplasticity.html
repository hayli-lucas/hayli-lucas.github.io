      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is described as the mind’s ability to form connections,
        change and adapt. It can be compared to a city and its roads (your brain
        and the connections it forms). When new roads are formed, the city runs
        more efficiently; likewise, your brain becomes stronger and improves
        itself when you learn a new thing or gain better understanding that
        creates stronger connections. It is all a part of training your brain
        and then reinforcing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some live under the false pretence that upon completing mainstream
        schooling, you are exempted from this training. This could not be
        further from the truth. If those roads are left to weather, the city
        becomes more isolated and starved, this would also affect the way your
        brain responds to receiving new information. It can prove difficult to
        pick up new information when you have been neglecting your brain its
        proper training.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, keep asking questions and keep seeking answers to
        continue reenforcing your brain’s infrastructure and when you do learn
        something new, don’t stop there; if you have the time to do some further
        research, do it. Not just for the sake of the current assignment of your
        coding course, but for the sake of your mind and its growth.
