      <h1>Introducing Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>

      <p>
        Typically, when you have a plan that you want to succeed, it is wise to
        have methods to support and strengthen yourself or else you will simply
        burn yourself out and set yourself up for failure. Here we will be
        looking at Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model and exploring
        methods that should benefit us and our learning plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary focus of the Te Whare Tapa Whā model is improving one’s
        wellbeing. Improving our wellbeing improves your mental health and
        promotes a better work ethic and productivity. Starting with taha
        tinana, or your physical wellbeing, we can commit to a task that allows
        our body to grow and strengthen. It is important to take care of our
        body as it is the vessel that carries us through life and all of its ups
        and downs. Of course, taking up any sport is a great way to take care of
        our taha tinana but it could also be as simple as going for a walk to
        the dairy and working on taking a couple extra steps every day and
        documenting your progress. We should also commit to eating a healthier
        diet and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taha Hinengara (or your emotional and mental wellbeing) is the core of
        what we are trying to improve. Our mind is very powerful. Many leaps not
        taken are due to mental blocks and negative self thoughts. Improving
        your taha hinengara can be intimidating but we are going to focus on the
        baby steps that will take us slowly to a better head space. Starting
        with some positive daily affirmations. At the start of the day, look in
        the mirror and tell yourself, “I am strong, I am loved, I have the power
        and the capabilities, I got this.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a great opportunity to bring up our next dimension of Te Whare
        Tapa Whā, which is our taha wairua (our spiritual wellbeing). Now, how
        one would work on improving their taha wairua is completely subjective
        and does not require you to be devoted to any religion or faith. In our
        case, we will start this journey by expressing gratitude through either
        prayer or through our positive affirmations. Try this by reminding
        yourself how lucky we are for even the simplest of things. We can even
        go as far as being grateful for the problems we have. Yes you read that
        right. Whenever you find yourself feeling down about how hard your
        workload is or how difficult a particular Sprint is, take a step back
        and say to yourself, “Wow, I’m so lucky that I am able to take this
        course and work for my achievements! I am so lucky that I am in a
        position where I can learn and grow even when times are rough.” It’s all
        about perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final dimension of Te Whare Tapa Whā is taha whānau (family
        wellbeing) which focuses on your sense of belonging and your sense of
        self. This does not have to be limited to your immediate family or even
        any blood relatives at all. We will on our taha whānau by committing to
        engage with those that we hold dear. A quick catchup once a week, or
        once a month can give a sense of purpose, connection with your family
        and strengthen your overall wellbeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember that this improvement has to be built on a solid foundation.
        Our land. Remember the phrase “The land has eyes and teeth.” If you take
        care of your home, your land, it will reward you. Keep in touch with the
        earth and she will provide for you. Remember to touch grass and love
        yourself. Take one step at a time and you will prosper.
