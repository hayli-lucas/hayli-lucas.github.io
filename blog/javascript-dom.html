    <h1>An Extreamly Basic Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      The relationship between JavaScript, HTML and CSS can be described as
      three components of a theatre production. HTML being the script of the
      play that defines the structure of the performance; HTML instructs what
      lines to say and what the scene should look like. It’s the foundation of
      your website. CSS oversees the costumes, lighting and set design. It adds
      all the visuals that draw in the audience’s attention, enhancing the
      experience for the viewer. All there is left is JavaScript, the director.
      JavaScript controls the actions and interactions on stage; it makes the
      actors move and adds all the surprise twists to the plot. When building a
      website, JavaScript reacts to user inputs and makes things happen
      dramatically on your page.
    </p>

    <p>
      When working with JavaScript, you’ll have to have an understanding of a
      “control flow” and “loops”. Control loops are if/else statements that
      makes decisions based on current conditions. Let’s say you want to make a
      cup of coffee, in order to make a cup of coffee, in order to successfully
      make a cup of coffee you will need all of the ingredients and equipment to
      prepare the coffee. Once these conditions are met, you can perform the
      function of making a nice cuppa but only IF those conditions are true.
    </p>

    <pre class="my-border image-container">
    if (HasAllIngredients = True && HasWorkingEquipment = True) {
      return "Sweet lets make some coffee!"
    }
    else {
      return "Uh oh... looks like we're forgetting something"
    }
 </pre
    >

    <p>
      Loops on the other hand, will take you through a certain process UNTIL a
      specified criteria is met. Imagine that we have a list of chores to do in
      order to get ready for work; You have to brush your teeth, have breakfast,
      have a shower, get changed, and all other habits that you fit into your
      own routine. A for loop will go through this list until you have checked
      off each item then indicating that the list has been completed.
    </p>

    <pre class="my-border image-container">
    let chores = [brush teeth, shower, breakfast, pack bag, grab keys, put on shoes]
    for (i = 0; i&lt;chores.length - 1; i++) {
      console.log('Chore: ' + chores[i])
    }
  </pre
    >

    <h1>WHAT IS A DOM?</h1>
    <p>
      A useful tool you should be aware of on your coding journey is the DOM
      (Document Object Model). The DOM can be described as a detailed map of
      whatever website on any browser. The Dom is essentially a built-in code
      editor to your browser where you can make temporary changes and experiment
      with different functions and formats.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h1>
    <p>
      The key difference you need to know between objects and arrays is that an
      array is essentially an order of items or data (a list) that you can
      extract from and manipulate.
    </p>

    <p>let shopping_list = [apples, milk, bread, crackers, jam]</p>

    <p>
      Objects are a collection of data set in key-value pairs that is not
      ordered but is instead grouped into meaningful labels.
    </p>
    <pre>
    let person = {
      name: 'John',
      age: 30,
      city: 'New York'
    };
  </pre
    >

    <h1>What is a Function and Why is it Helpful?</h1>
    <p>
      Coding is essentially telling your computer to do a bunch of commands to
      perform a certain task. You have to be really specific about what it is
      you want your computer to do in order to get the most accurate output;
      This can be very tedious and is just overall not good coding etiquette. A
      good rule of thumb to follow is that each task should have its own
      function. This will also help avoid repetition, allow easier debugging,
      and just make everything more organised for yourself and your team.
