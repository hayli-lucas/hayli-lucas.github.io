    <h1>An Extreamly basic introduction to JavaScript</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    The relationship between JavaScript, HTML and CSS can be described as three
    components of a theatre production. HTML being the script of the play that
    defines the structure of the performance; HTML instructs what lines to say
    and what the scene should look like. It’s the foundation of your website.
    CSS oversees the costumes, lighting and set design. It adds all the visuals
    that draw in the audience’s attention, enhancing the experience for the
    viewer. All there is left is JavaScript, the director. JavaScript controls
    the actions and interactions on stage; it makes the actors move and adds all
    the surprise twists to the plot. When building a website, JavaScript reacts
    to user inputs and makes things happen dramatically on your page.
