    <h1>An Extreamly basic introduction to JavaScript</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    The relationship between JavaScript, HTML and CSS can be described as three
    components of a theatre production. HTML being the script of the play that
    defines the structure of the performance; HTML instructs what lines to say
    and what the scene should look like. It’s the foundation of your website.
    CSS oversees the costumes, lighting and set design. It adds all the visuals
    that draw in the audience’s attention, enhancing the experience for the
    viewer. All there is left is JavaScript, the director. JavaScript controls
    the actions and interactions on stage; it makes the actors move and adds all
    the surprise twists to the plot. When building a website, JavaScript reacts
    to user inputs and makes things happen dramatically on your page.
  </p>

  <p>
    When working with JavaScript, you’ll have to have an understanding of a
    “control flow” and “loops”. Control loops are if/else statements that makes
    decisions based on current conditions. Let’s say you want to make a cup of
    coffee, in order to make a cup of coffee, in order to successfully make a
    cup of coffee you will need all of the ingredients and equipment to prepare
    the coffee. Once these conditions are met, you can perform the function of
    making a nice cuppa but only IF those conditions are true.
  </p>

  <pre class="my-border" , class="image-container">
    if (HasAllIngredients = True && HasWorkingEquipment = True) {
      return "Sweet lets make some coffee!"
    }
    else {
      return "Uh oh... looks like we're forgetting something"
    }
 </pre

  <p>
    Loops on the other hand, will take you through a certain process UNTIL a
    specified criteria is met. Imagine that we have a list of chores to do in
    order to get ready for work; You have to brush your teeth, have breakfast,
    have a shower, get changed, and all other habits that you fit into your own
    routine. A for loop will go through this list until you have checked off
    each item then indicating that the list has been completed.
  </p>

  <pre class="my-border" , class="image-container">
    let chores = [brush teeth, shower, breakfast, pack bag, grab keys, put on shoes]
    for (i = 0; i&lt;chores.length - 1; i++) {
      console.log('Chore: ' + chores[i])
    }
  </pre>
</body>
