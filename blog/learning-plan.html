    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p class="questions">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <br />
    To work a decent job that would require me to leave my cat for several hours
    per day several days per week. If I had the option to earn a good pay check,
    not have to budget for fuel costs commuting to work everyday all because I
    have the privilege to work from home and communicate with people
    face-to-face very often? Yes please! Write description of your strengths and
    limitations when it comes to learning. I would consider my strengths to
    consist of mostly my stubbornness to get things done when the odds are
    stacked against me. I would complete certain tasks out of spite of an
    imaginary critic (the little doubtful voice in your head) that makes you
    doubt yourself. Another strength I would name is my constant craving for
    knowledge. I always believe that there is more to learn about everything;
    this is enforced by the dopamine rush I get when I gain that understanding.
    As for my limitations, would have to mainly be how I have a temporary crash
    out when I stumble across a roadblock that I can’t seem to figure out. This
    would cause me to take a step back and take a break which can easily last
    the rest of the day, and I’d return to the problem the next day with a
    clearer mind. That time loss is not a good for someone who already struggles
    with time management.

    <p class="questions">
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <br />
    I’d like to develop my social skills and maybe my self-confidence. In school
    I used to struggle with asking questions or asking my teachers for help out
    of fear of judgment and general social anxiety. I eventually swallowed my
    pride and got over that fear and it turned out to be the best thing I ever
    did during my high-school academic years. Now I’ve come across a new but
    similar problem where we are encouraged to ask our peers for help/advice
    during study. So building the proper skills to communicate with others would
    definitely be a key skill I’d like to see flourish. Give a commitment as to
    how you will manage your workload in this programme. Keep a steady routine
    and form decent habits such as taking my ritilin every day and enforcing
    some self-discipline to ensure I get a decent amount of work in per day.
    Keeping up with every update posted on the Dev Academy discord and trying to
    be a bit more engaging with the group in asking questions and answering them
    (if I can). If things start to build up and get overwhelming, I’d reach out
    to my facilitator and discuss options, strategies, and methods to chip
    through the pile. But lets touch wood that that never happens.

    <p class="questions">
      Give a commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </p>
    <br />
    If all hope is lost in google and I really need the help, I’d go to my
    facilitator for help as they would be more reliable in their understanding
    of the study material. If I don’t get a response within a certain timeframe
    that’s relevant to the amount of time I have left until the deadline, I’d
    ask the help-desk or my group for help/advice. Write a description of what
    you expect from the Facilitation team. Oh gosh. Well I wouldn’t use words
    like expectations but I’d like them to know the material, have patience with
    my lack of group activity (i.e. being active in group discussions) during
    the early stages of the course and to maybe guide me in ways I could work
    through social issues and also let me know if my writing is ever too
    informal. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
    committed to other things? At this stage I’m not in a position where I have
    any long term block-out times as I don’t work or have kids. But I am
    actively looking for work so if the time comes where I’d have to allocate
    certain time slots for other commitments, I’ll be sure to update whoever is
    concerned.
