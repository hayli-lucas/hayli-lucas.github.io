    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you
    weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and
    how you reflect on the decision now. At the time of writing this, I can’t
    recall a specific ethical decision I’ve had to make because I’ve never had
    to weigh those options. It always seemed like a no-brainer. If I found a
    wallet with $500 in it, I’d obviously seek to return it. It would hurt a
    little because damn that’s a lot of money. But that’s someone else’s money.
    If I could locate the owner, I’d make contact and try return it. But if
    we’re being honest, I’d secretly hope for the unrealistic possibility where
    I’d get to keep the money. Describe how your culture and the people around
    you have influenced your values and identity. My Rotuman culture has taught
    me that family is the most valuable gift that God can give you. The people I
    choose to surround myself with enforce this by reminding me that family is
    not only limited by blood. My Fijian roots and upbringing taught me to be
    proud of who I am and where I come from. My friends remind me that I deserve
    to be proud of who I have become. Rotuman’s taught me charity and the love
    of giving and the rewards of hard work. We believe that anything is possible
    when your head and your heart are invested and you put in the work. My
    friends taught me that failure is okay and that an F really stands for
    “First attempt at life.” Identify your strengths and how they will support
    you during your learning journey. My strengths are my stubbornness and my
    constant need to prove the nagging voice in my head wrong. I have strength
    through my faith and my love for learning which will keep me going even
    through the hardest trials. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your
    learning and career development. How might these affect your learning
    journey? My limitations are associated with my stunted social skills, my
    pride, and my AuDHD. These make it difficult when stuck on a problem for a
    certain amount of time without any progress. I find it difficult to ask for
    help from my peers out of an unreasonable fear of judgement and the feeling
    that the problem is all in my head. Share an example of when you were trying
    to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
    Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your
    reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why. Last year
    July, my flatmates (my best friend of 10+ years and her boyfriend) and I
    decided to foster a puppy from our local SPCA. We ended up taking on three
    staffy mixes which we fostered for a little under a month. What I hadn’t
    considered at the time was how these pups needed 24-hour care. Which meant
    that someone had to be awake watching over them as they stayed indoors to
    ensure that we didn’t have any irreversible damage done to our furniture.
    The ways we went to go abouts this was taking 12 hours shifts. At first it
    was the couple watching over the dogs during the day when they were more
    active and I would watch over them at night, where yes, I’m alone, but they
    spent most of the night asleep anyways. Even with this routine, we couldn’t
    stick to it. Someone always needed some sort of help during the day which
    kept me awake and I always tried to push how long it took until I officially
    took over for night watch which kept them awake longer. This caused all of
    us to lose a LOT of sleep which grew the tension between the three of us
    rapidly. It didn’t help that these dogs were from a troubled litter and had
    behaviour issues that we were meant to fix to make them eligible for
    adoption. Also, it was the middle of winter, nightshift in winter sucks.
    Eventually we had to return one of the pups back to the SPCA that was
    initiating too many fights for us to break up. With two dogs left we decided
    to try our best before transferring shifts to tire the dogs out as much as
    possible so that they hopefully sleep through the night and to take turns
    with night shifts, taking turns every three days. As I reflect on this time,
    I think to myself that accepting to take on more than one dog was a real
    fucking dumb idea.
