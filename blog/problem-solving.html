    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <p>
      Through our journey, we have encountered many problems that left us with
      our heads in our hands. In this blog, I will take you through a particular
      problem I faced during Sprint 4’s Kata challenge and how the problem got
      solved. We will also dive into some other problem-solving techniques that
      can be explored and utilized in future scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the Built-In Methods section of the Kata challenge, I was
      instructed to use built-in commands so that my function will return a
      certain result and pass the tests. Now each part of the section had its
      own issues but the one that really stands out and that I will talk about
      was writing the whereAreYou function. This function took an array of
      objects as a parameter and what I had to do was use array’s ‘.find()’
      method look for one word (“Scooby”) amongst the array of objects. Upon
      first glance, I was not given the array of object that my code was
      supposed to sift through. This was easily solved by console logging the
      array which would display the array that I was working with.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real issue I had to deal with was simply the fact that no matter what
      I did, I couldn’t pass the tests, I couldn’t find Scooby. So I started
      trying to use different methods to get the desired result. I started by
      using what’s called the ‘rubber duck’ method, where you try explaining
      your problem to an inanimate object and talking to it like you would a
      person. Sometimes you are able to spot a problem just by explaining it out
      loud, describing it like you would to a facilitator in hopes of the
      solution just coming to you. That proved to be unsuccessful in my case so
      I moved on to another method feeling slightly more frustrated.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried using pseudocode to help guide myself through the problem. Where
      comments are inserted into the function that aid the author of the code
      and provide a visual aid, breaking down the function and describing what
      each line does. The issue with that solution was that this was a built-in
      method challenge, i.e. the solution was probably going to be a single line
      of code so there was really nothing to break down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally I just decided to turn to Google and search up everything I could
      about the .find() method. I needed to know how to pinpoint exactly what it
      is I wanted to find and that my code returns the object in which Scooby is
      hiding not anything else. From there I utilised one final method – try
      anything. From there it was only a matter of trial and error. Making small
      changes at a time and continuously console logging my function to see
      where it is that I am going wrong until finally, we found Scooby and all
      the tests were passed.
